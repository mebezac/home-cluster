    # "bind_user" should be the username you created for authentication with the "lldap_strict_readonly" permission. It is not recommended to use an actual admin account here.
    # If you are configuring Authelia to change user passwords, then the account used here needs the "lldap_password_manager" permission instead.

    # Optional: To allow sign in with BOTH username and email, you can change the users_filter to this
    # users_filter: "(&(|({username_attribute}={input})({mail_attribute}={input}))(objectClass=person))"
